/*
 * This should be compiled on mac and freebsd so that we have a setsid command
 * available. It will need to be in the path when run_all_tests.py is run on
 * those systems. If there's some other way to get the setsid command on mac
 * and freebsd, that would be nice, but I'm not sure of the official way of
 * obtaining it for those systems.
 *
 * jsamuel: I've commented out stdio.h and nls.h and related code to get this to
 * compile on mac and freebsd. Note that if you just run this directly from a
 * console like:
 *   ./setsid echo "tests"
 * you'll get an "Operation not permitted" error. The issue, I believe, is that
 * you're trying to call setsid from a process that already is a group leader.
 * If you instead call it from a process that isn't a group leader, it will work.
 * In linux it doesn't complain, and haven't looked into whether that's because
 * the restrictions are different, if it just ignores the setsid, if a console
 * is not a group leader by default, or whatever other explanations there could be.
