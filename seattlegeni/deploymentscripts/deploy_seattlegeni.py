<Purpose>
  Deploys all components of seattlegeni. Some things (e.g. database setup,
  config file modification to enter db user/pass info, etc.) still need
  to be done after this is run. See the instructions in:
  seattlegeni/README.txt

<Description>
  The script backs up the target deploy directory if it exists and the user
  wants to proceed. It then deploys all required files to the deploy
  directory the user specified.

<Usage>
  python deploy_seattlegeni.py <path/to/svn/trunk> <dir/to/deploy/to>
