<Purpose>
  This is the API that should be used to interact with the Lockserver.
  Functions in this module are the only way that other code should interact
  with the Lockserver.
   
  There is no provided function to unlock both user locks and node lock
  in a single call even though that is currently supported by the Lockserver.
  This can be added later, if needed.

  There are separate calls for locking/unlocking a single user or node
  and locking/unlocking multiple users or nodes. This is to make client
  code easier to read and less error-prone (e.g. forgetting to pass a
  list that contains a single name and instead directly passing the
  string that has the lock name).

  For details about the locking rules, see the module comments in
  lockserver_daemon.py.


<Usage>
  # Create a lockserver handle.
  lockserver_handle = create_lockserver_handle()

  # Lock request blocks until lock is obtained.
  lock_user(lockserver_handle, 'bob')

  # Release the user lock in a finally block.
  try:
    ...
    # Lock request blocks until lock is obtained.
    lock_multiple_nodes(lockserver_handle, ['123', '456'])
  
    # Release the node locks in a finally block.
    try:
      ...
    
    finally:
      # Unlock requests do not block.
      unlock_multiple_nodes(lockserver_handle, ['123', '456'])

  finally:
    # If unlock_user threw an exception here, we wouldn't destroy the lockserver
    # handle. That is not good, but it's not the critical error that failing to
    # release the user lock would be.
    unlock_user(lockserver_handle, 'bob')
  
    # Destroy the lockserver handle (don't forget to do this!)
    destroy_lockserver_handle(lockserver_handle)

  """
  <Purpose>
    Create a handle for communication with a lockserver. This is a required
    step before a client calls any of the (un)lock_* functions in this module.
    Note that a client should only create a single handle across multiple
    lock requests. This may require passing the handle around in function calls
    so that helper functions that create locks can use the same handle.
    It is very important that the lockserver handle be later destroyed by
    calling destroy_lockserver_handle().
  <Arguments>
    lockserver_url
      The url of the lockserver. Defaults to the lockserver running locally on
      its usual port.
