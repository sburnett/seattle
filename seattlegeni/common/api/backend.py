<Purpose>
  This is the API that should be used to interact with the backend XML-RPC
  server. Functions in this module are the only way that other code should
  interact with the backend.
   
  All components of seattlegeni use the backend to perform any nodemanager
  communication that changes the state of a node. ("State" here means
  modifying the node in any way, not "state" as in the "canonical state".)
  If the node only needs to be queried, not modified, then that can be
  done directly using the nodemanager api. This prevents the backend from
  needing to be called for regular querying done by polling daemons yet
  keeps the backend as the sole place where node changing operations
  are performed.
   
  The website uses only four functions in this module:
    acquire_vessel()
    release_vessel()
    generate_key()
    set_vessel_users()
     
  The other functions are used by polling daemons. In order to use the other
  functions, set_backend_authcode() must be called by the script first.
  
  Note that the none of these function calls will result in changes to the
  database. Any corresponding changes that also need to be made in the
  database must be made by any client code that uses this api.

    by polling daemons such as node state transition scripts.
