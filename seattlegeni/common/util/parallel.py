<Purpose>
  This module just provides a convenience function for using the repy
  parallelize module for parallelizing a function call. This is just to
  keep other code clean and prevent accidental leakage of the handles
  provided by the repy module for parallelized function.

   <Purpose>
      Call a function with each argument in a list in parallel.
   <Arguments>
      first_arg_list:
          The list of arguments the function should be called with. Each
          argument is passed once to the function.
      func:
          The function to call
      additional_args:
          Extra arguments the function should be called with (every function
          is passed the same extra args).
   <Exceptions>
      InternalError
        If running the parallelized function failed (failed to run at all, not
        just had each function call raise an exception).
   <Side Effects>
      Creates multiple threads to run func in parallel.
   <Returns>
      A dictionary with the results.   The format is
        {'exception':list of tuples with (target, exception string), 
         'aborted':list of targets, 'returned':list of tuples with (target, 
         return value)}
