<Purpose>
  This module provides a function, check_node(), which can be used to compare
  the information we have about a node in the database with the actual data
  the node reports. Optionally, the check_node() function will mark nodes as
  broken and release/mark for cleanup any vessels that are in an invalid
  state.
  
  Note that this module may be useful on the admin side of the website just
  for allowing an administrator to see what's wrong with a node. It's
  worth noting that this module isn't thread-safe, so if two requests made
  by administrators ran at the same time, the reported results they get back
  might be incorrect (especially if they are querying the same node at the same
  time). This lack of thread safety won't cause inaccurate actions to be taken
  on the database, though, because locks are used when not in readonly mode.
  
  A simple and lazy solution if lack of thread-safety becomes annoying would
  be to put the global data that is collected in a threading.local() data store
  and so not have to change much of the code. You might think that you could
  just require locks to be held for readonly requests, but that only reduces
  the problem, it doesn't eliminate it.

  <Purpose>
    Check a node for problems. This will try to contact the node and will
    compare the information retrieved from the node to the information we
    have in our database. It will log and collect the information about
    the problems. The problem information can be retrieved program
  <Arguments>
    node
      The Node object of the node to be checked.
    readonly
      False if the function should mark the node in the database as inactive
      or broken (and vessels released) when appropriate, True if it should
      never change anything in the database. Default is True.
    lockserver_handle
      If an existing lockserver handle should be used for lock acquisitions,
      it should be provided here. Otherwise, a new lockserver handle will
      be used the during of this function call.
      Note: no locking is done if readonly is True. That is, if there is
      no reason to lock a node, there is no reason to provide a
      lockserver_handle.
  <Exceptions>
    None
  <Side Effects>
    If readonly is False, the database may be updated appropriately based on
    what the function sees. No changes are ever directly made to the nodes
    through nodemanager communication regardless of the setting of readonly.
