  transition_onepercentmanyevents_to_canonical.py

<Purpose>
  Recently we have modified our resources file and going 
  to allocate a different amount of resources for each
  of the vessels. In order to do that we are going to have
  to transition the old nodes that are in the onepercentmanyevents
  state to a new state that we are going to call twopercent state.
  This is due to the fact the new vessels will have 2% cpu power
  instead of the 1% power it used to have. It will pass through
  the canonical state to get to the twopercent state. We already
  have a transition script that goes from the canonical state
  to the twopercent state, so we just have to bring all the 
  current nodes that are in the onepercent state to the canonical
  state.

<Usage>
  Ensure that seattlegeni and seattle are in the PYTHONPATH.
  Ensure that the database is setup properly and django settings
    are set correctly.

  <Purpose>
    This is the main launching point for this script. We are going
    to call the node_transition_lib and start the process of 
    moving from onepercentmanyevents state to the canonical state
    through an intermediate state the moving_to_canonical state.
    This wasy if anything fails, we can go back to the onepercent 
    state.

    None.

    None

  <Side Effects>
    A lot of nodes are altered.
