<Purpose>
  This is the XML-RPC Lockserver that is used by various components of
  SeattleGeni.
 
  Two lock types are supported: 'user' and 'node'.
 
  Multiple of the same lock type ('user' or 'node') can be requested at
  the same time, but a single lock acquisition request cannot include
  requests for both types of locks.
 
  Clients first request a session identifier from the lockserver and
  then make requests for acquiring and releasing locks using that
  session identifier. It is the client's responsibility to release any
  lock they have acquired and to let the lockserver know when they
  are finished with their session (that is, when they have released
  all of their locks and do not plan to acquire more locks in the
  same session).
 
  Clients are denied lock acquisition requests as follows:
    * If the client's session already holds 'user' locks and the client is
      requesting 'user' locks.
    * If the client's session already holds 'node' locks.
    * If the client's session has any pending (unfulfilled) lock requests.

  That is, a client must (in a given session) request and obtain user locks
  before requesting node locks if the client intends to hold both kinds of
  locks at the same time.
 
  If clients hold both user locks and node locks, the locks can be released
  in any order. As per the restrictions on lock acquisition, though, the
  client won't be able to obtain additional node locks until they have
  released all of the node locks they hold. They will also not be able
  to obtain additional user locks until they have released all of their locks.


XML-RPC Interface:
 
StartSession()
  <Purpose>
    Obtain a new session identifier that can be used to acquire/release locks.
  <Arguments>
    None.
  <Exceptions>
    None.
  <Side Effects>
    The new session identifier is reserved within the lockserver.
  <Returns>
    Returns a string with a new session id. The value will be unique with
    respect to all session ids currently being tracked by the lockserver.
 
EndSession(session_id_str)
  <Purpose>
    Destroys the specified session.
  <Arguments>
    session_id_str: the session id
  <Exceptions>
    This will evoke an xmlrpclib.Fault exception on the client side if the session
    does not exist or if the session has locked resources or pending lock requests.
  <Side Effects>
    Removes all information about the specified session.
    Since an Exception will occur if the session holds any locks or has any
    pending lock requests, it is mostly just removing the record of the session
    identifier.
  <Returns>
    None.
        
AcquireLocks(session_id_str, lockdict)
  <Purpose>
    Obtain a lock on one or more lock names of a given type. This is a blocking
    request.
  <Arguments>
    session_id_str: the session id
    lockdict: a "lockdict" (see notes below)
  <Exceptions>
    This will evoke an xmlrpclib.Fault exception on the client side if the request
    is for locks the client shouldn't be requesting. See the notes above that give 
    the reasons clients will be denied lock acquisition.
  <Side Effects>
    Blocks until all of the locks specified in the lockdict are obtained for
    the specified session.
  <Returns>
    None.
 
ReleaseLocks(session_id_str, lockdict)
  <Purpose>
    Release one or more locks of one or more types.
  <Arguments>
    session_id_str: the session id
    lockdict: a "lockdict" (see notes below)
  <Exceptions>
    This will evoke an xmlrpclib.Fault exception on the client side if the session
    does not hold one or more of the locks that are listed in the lockdict.
  <Side Effects>
    Releases the locks previously held by the session. The released locks
    will be immediately obtained by other sessions waiting on the same
    lock.
  <Returns>
    None.
 
GetStatus()
  <Purpose>
    Obtains information about locks that are held, who holds them, and
    what locks are needed by any sessions that are waiting on locks.
    This allows observing the current state of the lockserver.
  <Arguments>
    None.
  <Exceptions>
    None.
  <Side Effects>
    None.
  <Returns>
    A dictionary with two keys, "heldlockdict" and "sessiondict", is
    returned. The values of these keys are most of the contents of the global
    variables by the same names used within the lockserver itself.

 
Details of the "lockdict" format:
  The lockdict format is a dictionary with two possible valid keys, 'user'
  and 'node'. If the key exists, its value must be a list of strings. Each
  of the strings specifies the name of a lock (whose type is either 'user'
  or 'node').
   
  Examples of valid lockdicts:
    {'user':['bob']}
    {'node':['123','xyz']}
    {'user':['bob'], 'node':['123','xyz']}
   
  The last one above, {'node': ['bob'], 'user': ['123','xyz']}, would not
  be valid for an AcquireLocks request because it lists two different
  types of locks (both 'user' and 'node'). It would, however, be valid for a
  ReleaseLocks request.
   
  Examples of invalid lockdicts:
    {}
    {'user':None}
    {'user':[123]}     # the name of the lock must be a string, '123'
    {'user':[]}        # an empty list of names is not valid
    {'x':['bob']}      # 'x' is not a valid locktype (only 'user' and 'node')
 
 
<Notes> 
  The lock type of 'global' has not been implemented as there is no clear need
  for it at this time and it would increase complexity.
 
  The lockserver does not perform special handling of requests that disconnect
  from the server during a lock acquisition request. The client's session will
  ultimately be granted the locks (assuming it was a valid request).
 
  This implementation does not allow an individual session to make additional
  lock acquisition requests while an existing lock acquisition request by the
  same session is unfulfilled. It doesn't seem like it would be correct
  behavior on behalf of a client to do so, so it's not supported. One case
  where this might be an issue is with parallelized work by the same client
  code using the same session id.
 
 
  General overview of the code: 
 
  The functions that can be called through the xmlrpc interface are the the 
  public functions in the class called LockserverPublicFunctions. Each of those 
  functions sanitizes user input, obtains a global datalock (of which there is 
  one in the entire module), and calls a helper function to do the actual work. 
  The helper function for any public xmlrpc function named MyFunction is of the
  format do_my_function. The global datalock is not used anywhere but
  in the methods of LockserverPublicFunctions. All other code that modifies
  global data assumes that the global datalock is held.
 
  Each session is only allowed to make one call to AcquireLocks at a time.
  This is enforced by disallowing AcquireLocks setting a boolean flag in
  the data for that session to indicate the session has a pending AcquireLocks
  request.
 
  The blocking of request threads when all locks are not yet available is
  handled through the use of threading.Event() objects. Each session has
  a single Event() object. A single Event per session is adequate because
  each session is only allowed to make one AcquireLocks call at a time.
  The AcquireLocks call will wait on the session's Event object until
  it has been set, which is the signal that all of the requested locks
  have been acquired for that session. The event can either be set/signaled
  as a result of the AcquireLocks call (if all of the locks are available
  at the time of the request) or by ReleaseLocks calls made by any session
  (if a lock that is released leaves the blocked AcquireLocks request
  with no more locks needing to be acquired).
 

<TODOs>
  TODO: Test to find out how many blocked threads can be supported.
  TODO: Test that a blocked lock request will not disconnect if it
        is blocked for a very long time.
  TODO: Write more integration tests (at least to test invalid requests).
  TODO: Write a simple benchmark script.
