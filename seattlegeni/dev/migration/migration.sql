 * <Purpose>
 *   This is a sql script to migrate data from the old seattlegeni database
 *   to the new one. It assumes the old database is named `geni` and the new
 *   one is named `seattlegeni`.
 *
 *   There is some invalid data in the old database, so that also finds its
 *   way into the new database after migration. However, there's should be
 *   less incorrect state (and it should be more obvious when something is
 *   incorrect). For details, read through the rest of the comments in this
 *   file.

/*
The following tables are not migrated because it either a) doesn't make
sense to do so, b) the data does not appear to be current or, c) the tables
are empty:

auth_group
auth_group_permissions
auth_message
auth_permission
auth_user_groups
auth_user_user_permissions
django_admin_log
django_content_type
django_session django_site
 */




/* Empty all of the tables we're going to populate. They should already be
   empty, though. */

/*
Order of fields in the new control_node table:

id
node_identifier
last_known_ip
last_known_port
last_known_version
date_last_contacted
is_active
is_broken
owner_pubkey
extra_vessel_name
date_created
date_modified

WARNING:
There appear to be two active nodes without extra vessels. You can find them
after the migration using the following:
  SELECT * FROM seattlegeni.control_node WHERE extra_vessel_name = '' AND is_active = 1 
They appear to be nodes id 3413 and 3475 and they actuall appear to not have any vessels.
You can check this on the old database with:
  SELECT * FROM geni.control_vessel WHERE donation_id IN (3413, 3475)

WARNING: 
Some vessel records in the old database indicate there is more than one extra vessel on a node:
   SELECT donation_id FROM geni.control_vessel GROUP BY donation_id HAVING SUM(extra_vessel) > 1
The ids 1295, 2476, 2486, 3500 were obtained from the query above.
Note that node 3500 looks like it may be an active node, so this one might require manual work
after the migration to get the database in the right state for it.
This is the reason we have the LIMIT 1 in the subquery to get the extra vessel's name below.

Note:
After the import, we can compare the list of extra vessels between the old and new
databases by comparing the output of the following two queries:
  1) SELECT donation_id, name FROM geni.control_vessel WHERE extra_vessel = 1 ORDER BY donation_id
  2) SELECT id, extra_vessel_name FROM seattlegeni.control_node WHERE extra_vessel_name <> '' ORDER BY id
The result should match with the exception of the nodes (1295, 2476, 2486, 3500) that have multiple
vessel records in the old db that are marked as extra vessels.
Here's the difference with a diff of the two outputs:
$ diff old.out new.out
1c1
< donation_id   name
---
> id    extra_vessel_name
937d936
< 1295  v33
1680d1678
