			<h2><a name="whatisgeni">What is SeattleGENI</a></h2>
			<p>
			
			  SeattleGENI is a web-based portal for managing <a
			    href="https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/">Seattle</a>
			   resources. These resources are donated by
			   users who install Seattle on their
			   machines. In return these users are allowed
			   to use resources donated by others. SeattleGENI
			   enables users of donated resources to
			   acquire nodes around the world on which
			   they can then execute programs written in
			   <a
			    href="https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/wiki/RepyTutorial">Repy</a>,
			   the Seattle platform programming language.
			   Our current policy is that if you donate
			   10% of resources on your computer, you can
			   trade these donated resources in for 1% of
			   resources on 10 other computers. Using
			   SeattleGENI, users can also share their resources
			   with other SeattleGENI users, and to perform a
			   variety of other tasks. For more
			   information about about how SeattleGENI fits with
			   the rest of the Seattle platform, see <a
			    href="https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/wiki/SeattleComponents">this
			   page</a>. </p>

			<h2><a name="howtouse">How to use the SeattleGENI portal</a></h2>
			
			<p>The SeattleGENI portal is divided into four
			  sections, each of which can be accessed
			  through a tab at the top of the
			  page. Remember to maintain account security
			  and to always
			  <strong>Log Out</strong> of your session by clicking on
			  the Logout link at the top right of the page.
			</p>

			<p>The remainder of this section describes the
			  various functions accessed via each of the
			  tabs.
			</p>

			<h3><a name="profile">Profile : User keys, port, and other
			information</a></h3>

			
			<p>Here you you can manage your SeattleGENI account
			and find out meta information necessary for
			you to write programs for Seattle.</p>


			<ul>
			  <li><strong>Download the demokit.</strong> The demokit
			  includes the Seattle shell which you will
			  need to run programs on your acquired
			  vessels. For more information on how to use
			  the Seattle shell, see <a href="https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/wiki/SeattleShell">this page</a>.
			  </li>

			  <li><strong>Download the public and private
			  keys.</strong> You will need these two key files
			  to access your acquired vessels. Once you
			  download them, place the two key files in
			  the same directory as Seattle shell you
			  downloaded with the Seattle demokit
			  above. <p class="warning">For better security we recommend
			  that you download and delete your private
			  key from the server. Always store your
			  private key in a secure location. </p>
			  </li>

			  <li><strong>User Port.</strong> Each user is allocated
			  unique UDP and TCP port resources. The
			  port number you see on this page is a port
			  number you will be able to use in your Seattle
			  programs.  </li>
			</ul>

			<h3><a name="mygeni">My SeattleGENI : Inspecting donations, managing resource shares</a></h3>
			
			<p>This page helps you visualize and manage
			your Seattle resources, as well as the create,
			modify, and delete resource shares with other
			Seattle users.</p>

			<ul>

			  <li><strong>My Credits</strong> displays the total
			  resources you have at your disposal (number
			  of vessels you may acquire). It also
			  attributes these resources to either
			  donations made by users who have installed
			  your Seattle installers, or by users who
			  have shared their resources with you.</li>

			  <li><strong>Resource usage</strong> displays how the
			  resources available to you are being
			  used. Some of these will be used by you
			  ('Me'), others will be used by users with
			  whom you've shared your resources.</li>
			  
			  <li><strong>Managing shares.</strong> You can
			  <strong>create</strong> new shares with Seattle users
			  by clicking on 'share' on the bottom left of
			  the page in the box labeled as 'Free'. You
			  can <strong>delete</strong> existing shares, by
			  clicking the 'X' in the share box you would
			  like to remove. You can <strong>modify</strong> an
			  existing share by clicking on the share
			  box. This will allow you to change the
			  percent of resources allocated to the
			  share.</li>

			  <li><strong>Getting more vessels.</strong> Besides
			  sharing your resources, you make also redeem
			  your available resources as vessels. You can
			  do so by clicking 'get' in the box labeled
			  as 'Free'. At this point you will be
			  redirected to the 'My Vessels' tab (see below).

			  
			</ul>
			
			<h3><a name="myvessels">My Vessels : Managing vessels -- acquiring and releasing vessel resources</a></h3>
			
			<p>On this page you can see more detailed
			information about your acquired vessels, including
			name, location, and expiration time. This page also
			allows you to acquire more vessel resources, or remove
			the ones you currently have.</p>

			<ul>

			  <li><strong>Vessel Information.</strong> For each
			  vessel that you acquire, you will see an
			  entry in the table with the <strong>vessel
			  location</strong> (denoted by its IP address) and
			  <strong>vessel name</strong>. This is the name that seash
			  will display when you browse your vessels. Each vessel also
			  has an <strong>expiration time</strong> listed. This is the
			  time remaining until your hold on the vessel expires and it
			  is returned to the Seattle pool for use by other users.

			  <li><strong>Getting more vessels.</strong>

			  Above the table with vessel information,
			  you'll see a form in which you can select
			  the number of vessels that you would like to
			  acquire, and the type of network environment
			  you would like to have between the acquired
			  vessels. There are three choices for the
			  environment: </li>

			  <ul>

			    <li><strong>WAN</strong> : Wide area network. The vessels
			    will be as spread out as possible.</li>
			    
			    <li><strong>LAN</strong> : Local area network. The vessels
			    will be on the same local network. </li>

			    <li><strong>Random</strong> : A random selection of
			    vessels, and an unpredictable network
			    environment.</li>
			    
			  </ul>

			</ul>
			
			<h3><a name="getdonations">Get Donations : Donating to the platform</a></h3>

			<p>

			  This page contains links to Seattle
			  installers for different platforms: Windows,
			  OS X, and Linux. These installers donate the
			  resources on a machine to your account. To
			  simplify distribution of these installers,
			  this page also includes a link at the top
			  that you can email to people who might help
			  you by installing Seattle and contributing
			  resources on their machines on your behalf.
			  This link points to a page that
			  contains the same set of installers, and a
			  help page that explains what is involved in
			  donating to the Seattle platform.
