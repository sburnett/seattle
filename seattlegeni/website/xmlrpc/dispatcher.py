<Purpose>
  XMLRPC handler for django.

  Nothing in this file needs to be modified when adding/removing/changing
  public xmlrpc methods. For that, see the views.py file in the same directory.

  This xmlrpc dispatcher for django is modified from the version at:
  http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/XML-RPC

  All xmlrpc requests are initially routed here by django. The actual functions we

  what we return from the functions in views.py will be turned into a valid xmlrpc
  response.
  
  If POST data is defined, it assumes it's XML-RPC and tries to process as such.
  If the POST data is empty or if it is a GET request, this assumes the request is
  from a browser and responds saying it's an xmlrpc service.
  
  This function does not need to be called from anywhere other than having it
  defined in urls.py. That is, you generally shouldn't need to ever use this
  function directly.
