<Purpose>
  This file defines all of the public SeattleGeni XMLRPC functions. When the
  SeattleGENI XMLRPC API changes, this file will generally always need to be
  modified.  

  To create a new xmlrpc function, just create a new method in the
  PublicXMLRPCFunctions class below. All public methods in that class
  are automatically registered with the xmlrpc dispatcher.

  The functions defined here should generally be making calls to the
  controller interface to perform any work or retrieve data.

  Be sure to use the following decorators with each function, in this order:

  @staticmethod -- this is a python decorator that prevents 'self'
                   from being passed as the first argument.
  @log_function_call -- this is our own decorator for logging purposes.
