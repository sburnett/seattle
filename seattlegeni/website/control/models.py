<Purpose>
  This file contains definitions of model classes for the main database
  of SeattleGeni. These models are used by django to 1) create the database
  schema, and 2) to define an interface between django applications and the
  database.

  For information on how models are defined in django apps, see
  http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/models/

  Changes to these models should be done with corresponding changes
  to the design document at https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/wiki/SeattleGeniDesign
