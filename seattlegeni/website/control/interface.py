<Purpose>
  This module presents the only methods that a frontend action will call. These
  methods do the work of ensuring that an action requested through a frontend
  are performed. The resulting data that the frontend needs is returned from
  these methods.
  
  This module should be the only point of entry from a frontend to the rest of
  the code base.

  Functions in this module will make calls to the following APIs:
    * backend
    * keygen
    * lockserver
    * maindb
  
<Notes>
  * All references to user here are to our GeniUser model, not to the django user.
  
  * The functions that modify the seattlegeni database or perform actions on
    nodes all do an extra check to ensure the user is valid after obtaining a
    user lock. This is to ensure that user has not been deleted and to see other
    changes to the user that were made between the time that the request was
    made and when the lock was obtained.
    
  * When using this module from the frontend views, you do not need to catch
    InternalError, ProgrammerError, or otherwise uncaught exceptions. Those
    are allowed to trickle all the way up and get handled based on how we've
    configured django.
