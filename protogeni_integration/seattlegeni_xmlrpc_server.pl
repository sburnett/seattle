  # <Purpose>
  #   This is where we retrieve a seattlegeni user and their credential that
  #   we will use later on to acquire resources. There are several dedicated
  #   username for the protogeni integration. Each time CreateSliver is called,
  #   we will take one of these user names that are available and return its
  #   credentials. In this case the credentials are the username, the api key,
  #   and the publick key string. Every time we find an available user name,
  #   we have to regenerate its api key, and assign it a new random public key
  #   string. This is because a previous user may still hold on to the old api
  #   key and public key string, and we don't want them to have access to the
  #   new resources that we will allocate for the current user. This way we 
  #   ensure that only the current user has access to the newly allocated 
  #   resources.
  #
  #  <Arguments>
  #    None.
  # 
  #  <Side Effects>
  #    We call the seattlegeni xmlrpc server twice.
  #
  #  <Exceptions>
  #    If all the usernames are active and are being used right now, we are 
  #    going to respond with an 'unavailable resources' response.

  #    We are going to return the seattlegeni authentication which is the
  #    username and the new api key. We will also return  the new
