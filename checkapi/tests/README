Additionally the standard repy_v2 unit tests can be used with some minor exceptions.
Details on the specific exceptions are discussed on the CheckAPI wiki:

https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/wiki/CheckAPI

These tests can be run by putting them in the same directory as a working 
version of CheckAPI and then executing each one with the following command:

python repy.py <RESTRICTIONS_FILE> encasementlib.repy dylink.repy test_core_model_<NAME>
