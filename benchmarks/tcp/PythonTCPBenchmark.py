<Purpose>
  Sends a specific amount of bytes with a specific chunk size and records the
  time that it required to complete.

<TODO>
  Right now the client cannot reuse its port, even if the socket is
  closed in clientSend(). Have to: (1) find out why this is the case
  and (2) set a socket reuse option so that the client can reuse the
  port.

  Need to extend the server to:
  - Be able to receive multiple connections and benchmark each one.

  Change the client-server benchmarking protocol to:
  - Have the client send the server the number of bytes it will send,
    so the server know how much data to expect.

  - Might want the server acknowledge the client's initial
    message. This might or might not be necessary since the server
    should do the benchmarking (see below).

  - Benchmark the time it takes the *server* to receive the data, not
    the time it takes the client to send the data, because send() is
    deceiving -- it queues data in kernel but does not indicate
    reception!
