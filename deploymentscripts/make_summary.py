<Purpose>
  This file produces summary files and the complete log files from all of the machines
  surveyed.  The log files are collected from their respective directories, and then 
  they are throw into one file. The HTML file is also created via this file.


<Usage>
  python make_sumary.py
  
  Will parse all logs in deploy_logs directory and use time.time() for the timestamp.
