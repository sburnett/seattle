<Purpose>
  This is the file contains network-related functions that are used by the 
  deployment script.  This file is not to be executed by itself, but is to
  be used with deploy_*.

  <Purpose>
    This function connects to user@remote_host using the specified rsa key.
    Typically, only the user and remote_host fields need to be changed - the 
    RSA key used is the user's default RSA key.  After connecting, this will
    extract runlocaltests.py from the tar_filename and execute it remotely.
     
  <Arguments>
    user:
      the user to log in as on the remote machine.
    remote_host:
      the remote machine's IP to which we'll be uploading files.
    custom_script_name:
      the name(s) as strings of custom scripts to run on the remote machine.
    run_custom_only:
      Should we only run the custom script?
    tar_filename: 
      Optional. Default is deploy.tar. The tar file to upload to the remote
