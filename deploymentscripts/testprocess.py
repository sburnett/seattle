The rawsay function and its dependencies have been written by Justin Cappos,
but the functions nmclient_rawcommunicate and nmclient_rawsay have been slightly modified to take ip and port arguments
instead of the original handle argument. This was done to keep the code simple and the file short.
The full functionality of signed requests is not needed for this test, since we are only using rawsay.

Motivation:
The purpose of this script is to be used as a component in an automated system that detects and fixes problems with the repy installation on linux machines. The purpose of this script is to detect problems with the node manager and software updater processes and report them. 

Description:
This script verifies whether the node manager process is running and verifies whether the software updater is running.
This script also verifies whether the ndoe manager si running on port 1224 by sending a getVessels request and waiting for a reply.
This script will only work on linux.
It is necessary that this script be run from a directory that contains the repyportability module and its dependencies. 

expected output:
ProcessCheckerFinished

If the software updater is not running the following is printed:
'[SoftwareUpdater] Software Updater is not running.'

If there are two or more Software Updater Processes running, the following is printed:
'[SoftwareUpdater] Multiple instances of Software Updater are running.'

If exactly one software updater process is running, but its memory usage is severely higher than expected, the following is printed:
[SoftwareUpdater] Software Updater memory usage is unussually high.

If exactly one software updater process is running, but its memory usage is severely lower than expected, the following is printed:
[SoftwareUpdater] Software Updater memory usage is unussually low.

If exactly one software updater process is running, but it is Stopped (T), Dead (X), or Defunct (Z), the following is printed:
[SoftwareUpdater] Software Updater process is Stopped, Dead, or Defunct.

If exactly one software updater process is running, but its cpu usage exceeds 50% the following is printed:
[SoftwareUpdater] Software Updater process has cpu usage above 50%.

If the node manager is not running, the following is printed:
'[NodeManager] Node Manager is not running.'

If there are two or more Node Manager Processes running, the following is printed:
'[NodeManager] Multiple instances of Node Manager are running.'

If exactly one node manager process is running, but its memory usage is severely higher than expected, the following is printed:
[NodeManager] Node Manager memory usage is unussually high.

If exactly one node manager process is running, but its memory usage is severely lower than expected, the following is printed:
[NodeManager] Node Manager memory usage is unussually low.

If exactly one node manager process is running, but it is Stopped (T), Dead (X), or Defunct (Z), the following is printed:
[NodeManager] Node Manager process is Stopped, Dead, or Defunct.

If exactly one node manager process is running, but its cpu usage exceeds 50% the following is printed:
[NodeManager] Node Manager process has cpu usage above 50%.

If the node manager is running, but is not responding to requests on port 1224, the following is printed:
'[NodeManager] Node Manager is not responding to requests on port 1224.'

Regardless of whether there are errors or not detected, ProcessCheckerFinished will be printed upon script termination.
