			<h3>What is GENI</h3>
			<p>GENI is a portal that manages resources donated by users who have donated resources by installing Seattle. GENI enables users of donated resources to acquire resources (e.g. nodes around the world) on which they can then execute programs written in Repy, the Seattle platform programming language. GENI also lets your share of the resources with other users, to release acquired resources that are no longer needed, and perform a variety of other tasks. This is meant to be a rough sketch. For more information about about how GENI fits with the rest of the Seattle platform, see this page.</p>
