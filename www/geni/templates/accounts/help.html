			<h2><a name="introduction">What is SeattleGENI</a></h2>

			<p>
			  SeattleGENI is a web-based portal for
			  managing <a href="https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/">Seattle</a>
			  resources. These resources are donated by
			  users who have installed Seattle on their
			  machines. In return these users are allowed
			  to use resources donated by others. SeattleGENI
			  enables users of donated resources to
			  acquire nodes around the world on which they
			  can then execute programs written
			  in <a href="https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/wiki/RepyTutorial">Repy</a>,
			  the Seattle platform programming
			  language. SeattleGENI also lets users to share
			  their resources with other users, and
			  perform a variety of other tasks. For more
			  information about about how SeattleGENI fits with
			  the rest of the Seattle platform,
