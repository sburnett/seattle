    <h3><a name="intro">Introduction to Beraber Donation</a></h3>
    <p>By running Seattle on your home computer, workstation, or
    computer, you are helping everyone using the Beraber framework!
    By making your donation available to Beraber users, you are 
    allowing users to try new topologies of nodes.
    This enables both more accurate representations of Internet 
    (increased and varied latency times) and allows more undergraduates, 
    graduate students, and professors to test their hypotheses on a 
    internetwork-like testbed without charge.</p>

    <p>The philosophy of the Beraber project is use donationed resources in a 
    way that is <strong>secure (including performance-isolation)</strong>.  
    Programs that run donated resources are isolated so that a program can't
    write or read files it isn't supposed to or do other bad things to your
    computer.  The Beraber framework also ensures fair play with each donation 
    by isolating the performance of your programs from the programs that run 
    on donated resources.  Our promise to you is to use no more than 10% of 
    your computer's resources XXX: footnote{Computational resources are
    things like RAM, CPU time, network bandwidth, and hard drive space.
    We're working on allowing you to reset the percentages or absolute value
    to allow you to change the amount.   }.  </p>

    <h3><a name="install">Installing Beraber</a></h3> 
    <p>Running Beraber on your machine is easy.  Simply start the
    install script (install.bat or install.sh, depending on the type of
    your system), and the application will do three things.  (1) start
    the main communication program, nmmain.py (standing for node
    manager main thread), (2) start up the software updater, and (3)
    insert nmmain.py into your startup queue (crontab for linux/apple,
    startup items for windows). </p>

    <h3><a name="pause">Pausing Beraber</a></h3>
    <p>To pause the execution of Beraber, run the python script
    seattlestopper.py (or use the script stop_seattle.sh).  To
    unpause, run the python script seattlestarter.py (or use the
    script start_seattle.sh).  During the paused period, your
    computer's resources will not be consumed by student programs.</p>

    <h3><a name="uninstall">Uninstalling Beraber</a></h3>
    <p>If you decide to end your donation, Beraber can be uninstalled
    simply by running the python script uninstall.py (or the script
    uninstall.sh).  This process will remove Beraber from the startup
    queue, deactivate the main thread, and remove the execution from
    the user's crontab (if applicable).  </p>

    <h3><a name="questions">Comments or Questions</a></h3>
    We would also like to know about
    your experiences with Beraber.   If you have any questions or comments
    please drop a message to our
    <a href="mailto:seattle.devel@cs.washington.edu" title="E-mail our
    developer list">developer list</a>!  We're always striving to
    make a better experience for all.</p>
