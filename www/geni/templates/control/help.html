			<h2><a name="whatisgeni">What is GENI</a></h2>
			<p>
			GENI is a portal that manages resources
			donated by users who have donated resources by
			installing <a href="https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/">Seattle</a>. GENI
			enables users of donated resources to acquire
			resources (e.g. nodes around the world) on
			which they can then execute programs written
			in <a href="https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/wiki/RepyTutorial">Repy</a>,
			the Seattle platform programming
			language. GENI also lets your share of the
			resources with other users, to release
			acquired resources that are no longer needed,
			and perform a variety of other tasks. This is
			meant to be a rough sketch. For more
			information about about how GENI fits with the
			rest of the Seattle platform,
			see <a href="https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/wiki/SeattleComponents">this
			  page</a>.
			</p>

			<h2><a name="howtouse">How to use the GENI portal</a></h2>
			
			<p>The GENI portal is divided into four
			  sections, each of which can be accessed
			  through a tab at the top of the
			  page. Remember to maintain account security
			  and to always
			  <b>Log Out</b> of your session by clicking on
			  the Logout link at the top right of the page.
			</p>

			<p>The remainder of this section describes all
			the functions accessed in each of these tabs.
			</p>

			<h3><a name="profile">Profile : User keys, port, and other
			information</a></h3>

			<hr />
			
			<p>Here you you can manage your GENI account
			and find out meta information necessary for
			you to write programs for Seattle.</p>


			<ul>
			  <li><b>Download the toolkit.</b> The toolkit
			  includes the Seattle shell which you will
			  need to run programs on your acquired
			  vessels. For more information on how to use
			  the Seattle shell, see <a href="https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/wiki/Seash">this</a> page.
			  </li>

			  <li><b>Download the public and private
			  keys.</b> You will need these two key files
			  to access your acquired vessels. Once you
			  download them, place the two key files in
			  the same directory as Seattle shell you
			  downloaded with the Seattle toolkit
			  above. <i>For better security we recommend
			  that you download and remove your private
			  key from the server. Always store your
			  private key in a secure location. </i>
			  </li>

			  <li><b>User Port.</b> Each user is allocated
			  a unique UDP and TCP port resources. The
			  port number you see on this page is the port
			  number you have to use in your Seattle
			  programs.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3><a name="mygeni">My GENI : Inspecting donations, managing resource shares</a></h3>

			<hr />
			
			<p>This page helps you visualize and manage
			your Seattle resources, as well as the create,
			modify, and delete resource shares with other
			Seattle users.</p>

			<ul>

			  <li><b>My Credits</b> displays the total
			  resources you have at your disposal (number
			  of vessels you may acquire). It also
			  attributes these resources to either
			  donations made by users who have installed
			  your Seattle installers, or by users who
			  have shared their resources with you.</li>

			  <li><b>Resource usage</b> displays how the
			  resources available to you are being
			  used. Some of these will be used by you
			  ('Me'), others will be used by users with
			  whom you've shared your resources.</li>
			  
			  <li><b>Managing shares.</b> You can
			  <b>create</b> new shares with Seattle users
			  by clicking on 'share' on the bottom left of
			  the page in the box labeled as 'Free'. You
			  can <b>delete</b> existing shares, by
			  clicking the 'X' in the share box you would
			  like to remove. You can <b>modify</b> an
			  existing share by clicking on the share
			  box. This will allow you to change the
			  percent of resources allocated to the
			  share.</li>

			  <li><b>Getting more vessels.</b> Besides
			  sharing your resources, you make also redeem
			  your available resources as vessels. You can
			  do so by clicking 'get' in the box labeled
			  as 'Free'. At this point you will see a
			  window in which you may select the number of
			  vessels that you would like to acquire, and
			  the type of network environment between
			  these vessels. There are three choices for
			  the environment:

			  <ul>

			    <li>WAN : Wide area network. The vessels
			    will be as spread out as possible.</li>
			    
			    <li>LAN : Local area network.The vessels
			    will be on the same local network. </li>

			    <li>Random : A random selection of
			    vessels, and an unpredictable network
			    environment.</li>
			    
			  </ul>

			</ul>
			
			<h3><a name="myvessels">My Vessels : Managing vessels -- acquiring and releasing vessel resources</a></h3>
			<hr/ >
			
			<p>On this page you can see more detailed
			information about your acquired vessels, such
			as their IP addresses, and how long you have
			before the vessels are released. This page
			also allows you to acquire more vessel
			resources.</p>

			<ul>

			  <li><b>Vessel Information.</b> For each
			  vessel that you acquire, you will see a
			  record in the table on this page that tells
			  you the <b>vessel id</b> which is the same
			  id that your seash session will display when
			  you browse your vessels. You will also see
			  the <b>vessel status</b> which will tell you
			  whether the vessel is in the correct
			  state. Also you will see an <b>expires
			  in</b> time value which indicates how long
			  you have before the vessel will be returned
			  back into the Seattle pool for use by other
			  users.</li>

			  <li><b>Getting more vessels.</b> See above
			    for a description of how the vessel
			    acquisition process works. 
			  </li>

			</ul>
			
			<h3><a name="getdonations">Get Donations : Donating to the platform</a></h3>

			<hr />

			<p>This page contains three links to Seattle
			  installers for different platforms (Windows,
			  OS X, and Linux). These installers donate
			  the resources on a machine to your
			  account. To simplify distribution of these
			  installers, this page also includes a link
			  at the top that you can email to people who
			  might help you by installing Seattle and
			  contributing resources on their machines on
			  your behalf. This link will take them to a
			  page that contains the same set of
			  installers.</p>
