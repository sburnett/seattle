    	<p>The goal of the Seattle project is to build an open and free computational platform that makes distributed computation available to everyone. We believe that humanity benefits from an open, volunteer-driven, peer-to-peer infrastructure that can solve important computational tasks for users.  The Seattle project is being used to support students around the world, help researchers make the Internet a safer and more robust place, and Seattle is being used to help families in developing regions share photos to keep in touch. You, too, can make a difference just by running our software!</p>

        <p>FAQ</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Q: How do I ensure that a specific project I want to support gets credit for my resources?<br />
		A: The project should have a link to a specific installer they want you to use on their page. Use their installer.</p>
        
        <p>Q: I only want a specific project to be able to use my resources, how do I control this?<br />
        A: The project may have two different types of installers, restricted and free. A restricted installer will make it so that the project can't trade resources on your machine to another project in exchange for resources elsewhere. Please keep in mind that a restricted installer may make it harder for a project to get the type of resources they need.</p>
        
       <p>Q: I have a project and I want to use Seattle resources, how do I get started?<br />
