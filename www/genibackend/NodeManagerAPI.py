    <Purpose>
      Initializes the node manager.   Must be called before other operations.

    <Arguments>
      None.

    <Exceptions>
      It is possible for a time error to be thrown (which is fatal).

    <Side Effects>
      This function contacts a NTP server and gets the current time.
      This is needed for the crypto operations that we do later.
      This uses UDP port 23421

      None.
