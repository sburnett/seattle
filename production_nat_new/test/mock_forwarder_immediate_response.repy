<Purpose>
  A mock forwarder for testing the check behind nat functionality
  of the client
  
  usage: call start_mock_for(ip,port) to replicate a forwarder 
  listening on ip:port
  
  call stop_mock_for() to stop the listener
  
  this forwarder can only use the check_behind_nat feature
  and always returns a response without trying to open a connection
