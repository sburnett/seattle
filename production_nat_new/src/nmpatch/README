This directory contains the files that the Seattle needs to use shims. In
particular, the following modules are required:

ShimStackInterface.repy - The main library for shims.
nmmain.py               - The modified node manager that runs on shims.
nmclient.repy           - The modified client.
sockettimeout.repy      - The modified timeout socket object.


The following files are not needed for the production system, but they are
useful for development nonetheless.

addme.py                - Acquires the current vessels.
apply.sh                - Compiles the shim library from individual files.


TODO: More extensive logging is required for production.
