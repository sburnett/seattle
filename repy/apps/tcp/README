--==[ About ]==--
This code is an implementation of TCP over Repy's native UDP.
See the project wiki:
 https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/wiki/TopSecret

--==[ Testing ]==--
To run the test suite do:
 $ make

To run a subset of the tests use `make FN=<glob_expression>`.  
For example:
 $ # run only the test "z_test_me.py"
 $ make FN=z_test_me.py
Or:
 $ # run all tests of the class "connection"
 $ make FN=*connection*.py

To remove all the built files:
 $ make clean

--==[ Manifest ]==--
The code has the following layout:
 
 Makefile
        Runs test suite.

 tcp.repy
        Holds main interface class called Connection.

 *.repy
        Classes that tcp.repy depends on.

 tests/ 
        This folder contains TCP specific test files.  The
        files include test helpers and actual test files.
        
	*.txt
		Input files to test sending large amounts of data.

        build.sh
		Pre-processes test files in folder through Repypp.
		Used by Makefile.

        [ze]_test_<classname>*.py
        	TCP tests.  Need to be built by running Makefile.
		Organized by classname.  So z_test_client*.py includes
		all tests of the class Client() found in the file
		client.repy.

        evil_tcp.repy
		Holds a fake Connection class called EvilConnection.
 		Allows you to test whether a connection is vulnerable
		(malformed packets, random state changes, window overflow,
 		etc.)

	run_tests.py
		Seattle's test runner slightly modified.

        restrictions.default
		All tests run through Repy with this restrictions
                file.
     
        stub_tcp.repy
                Holds a fake Connection class called StubConnection.
     		Allows you to test internals of a connection (number of
  		packets sent, sequence number handling, retries, etc.)
