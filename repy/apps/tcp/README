--==[ About ]==--
This code is an implementation of TCP over Repy's native UDP.
See the project wiki:
 https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/wiki/TopSecret

--==[ Testing ]==--
To run the test suite do:
 $ make

To run an individual test use `make run FN=<testname>`.  
For example, to run a test "unit_tests/z_test_me.py":
 $ make run FN=z_test_me.py

To remove all the built files:
 $ make clean

--==[ Manifest ]==--
The code has the following layout:
 
 Makefile
        Runs test suite.

 tcp.repy
        Holds main interface class called Connection.

 *.repy
        Classes that tcp.repy depends on.

 test/ 
 	This folder holds Repy, Repypp, and files needed
        for them to run.  Used for building and running 
        TCP tests.  Does not contain any TCP specific code.
 
        restrictions.default
		All tests run through Repy with this restrictions
                file.
     
 unit_tests/
        This folder contains TCP specific test files.  The
        files include test helpers and actual test files.
        
        build.sh
		Pre-processes test files in folder through Repypp.
		Used by Makefile.

        [ze]_test*.py
        	TCP tests.  Need to be built by running Makefile.

        evil_test.repy
		Holds a fake Connection class called EvilConnection.
 		Allows you to test whether a connection is vulnerable
		(malformed packets, random state changes, window overflow,
 		etc.)

        stub_test.repy
                Holds a fake Connection class called StubConnection.
     		Allows you to test internals of a connection (number of
  		packets sent, sequence number handling, retries, etc.)
