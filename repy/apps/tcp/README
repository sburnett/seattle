--==[ About ]==--
This code is an implementation of TCP over Repy's native UDP.
See the project wiki:
 https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/wiki/TopSecret

--==[ Testing ]==--
To run the test suite do:
 $ make

To run a subset of the tests use `make FN=<glob_expression>`.  
For example:
 $ # run only the test "z_test_me.repy"
 $ make FN=z_test_me.repy
Or:
 $ # run all z tests of the class "connection"
 $ make FN=z_test_connection*

To remove all the built files:
 $ make clean

--==[ Manifest ]==--
The code has the following layout:
 
 *.repy
        Classes.

 Makefile
        Runs test suite.

 tests/ 
        This folder contains TCP specific test files.  The
        files include test helpers and actual test files.
        
	*.txt
		Input files to test sending large amounts of data.

        build.sh
		Pre-processes test files in folder through Repypp.
		Used by Makefile.

        [ez]_test_*.py
        	TCP tests.  Need to be built by running Makefile.

        restrictions.default
		All tests run through Repy with this restrictions
                file.

	run_tests.py
		Seattle's test runner slightly modified.
     
--==[ Unit test files ]==--
Unit test files may be in the format '''z_test_<classname>_<function_name>.repy'''.  These unit
test files just test a single class function.  For example, a unit test file of Connection.bind would be in the file '''z_test_connection_bind.repy'''.  Each such unit 
test file contains test functions. Each test function tests a condition (ex. if branch) of a class function.

--==[ Functional test files ]==--
A functional test file may exist for a class.  A functional test file tests how the different functions in a single class interact.  Name a functional test file like 
'''z_test_<classname>.repy'''.  For example, a functional test file of Connection would be in the file '''z_test_connection.repy'''.  A functional test file contains test 
functions.  Each test function calls multiple related class functions and makes sure they interact correctly.
