--==[ About ]==--
This code is an implementation of TCP over Repy's native UDP.
See the project wiki:
 https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/wiki/TopSecret

--==[ Manifest ]==--
The code has the following layout:
 *.repy - Classes.
 Makefile - Runs test suite.
 tests/ - The files here are test file-folders, classes, resources, and scripts.
	*.txt - Input files to test sending large amounts of data.
        build.sh - Pre-processes test files in folder through Repypp.
        restrictions.default - All tests run through Repy with this.
	run_tests.py - Seattle's test runner slightly modified.
        functionals/ - testing how functions of a single class interact
        integrations/ - testing how classes interact
	units/ - testing how each function of a class works in isolation

--==[ Testing ]==--
To run the test suite do:
 $ make

See Makefile for other options.
     
--==[ Unit test files ]==--
Unit test files may be in the format '''z_test_<classname>_<function_name>.repy'''.  These unit
test files just test a single class function.  For example, a unit test file of Connection.bind would be in the file '''z_test_connection_bind.repy'''.  Each such unit 
test file contains test functions. Each test function tests a condition (ex. if branch) of a class function.

--==[ Functional test files ]==--
A functional test file may exist for a class.  A functional test file tests how the different functions in a single class interact.  Name a functional test file like 
'''z_test_<classname>.repy'''.  For example, a functional test file of Connection would be in the file '''z_test_connection.repy'''.  A functional test file contains test 
functions.  Each test function calls multiple related class functions and makes sure they interact correctly.
