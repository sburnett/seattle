Installation

- Make sure, the file restrictions.tryrepy contains the serverport:
resource connport <serverport>

- run inside this directory
./tr_build.sh
./tr_run.sh </abspath/to/seattle_repy> <serverport>


############
Known Issues

- Print does not work, use log() instead.
- Infinity Loops can only be stopped by shutting down the entire server
- Exitall() does not work
- Thread Exceptions:
A thread exception in one thread does not exit the entire evaluation in a Virutal Namespace.  So far exceptions in a thread are caught and logged but the execution of other healthy threads continues.
- TCP/UDP listeners are not isolated
A listener registered on one IP:PORT will override another listener previously registered on this IP:PORT
