The software updater remote tests appear to be nothing more than a code-duplicating, broken
version of the local tests but with a remote webserver rather than a local webserver.
Leaving them mixed in with the other tests and documenting them on the wiki just confuses
people.

If you do want to run them, copy these files up one directory (that is, to the directory
softwareupdater/test/).
