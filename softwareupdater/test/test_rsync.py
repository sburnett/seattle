<Purpose>
  Test the rsync behavior in a varity of different ways.

  Note that while this can be used alone, it is mostly meant to be run from
  within test_runupdate.py.  See test_updater.py for more details.

<Usage>
  python test_rsync.py <testtype> <softwareurl>

  Test types:
  -u <filename1 filename2 ... >    Test will assert that all of the given
                                   filenames were updated correctly.
  -x	                  Test will assert that no updates have been made
  -e                      Test will assert that there was a proper
                          Exception thrown
  												
  Note, it is assumed that the files to be updated are all currently in the
  current directory
