<Start Date>
  February 14, 2009

<Purpose>
  Runs all the softwareupdater tests locally using the webserver written in 
  repy.

<Usage>
  Requires files from trunk/assignments/webserver/ and 
  trunk/softwareupdater/test/ as well as a normal preparetest.  Also, there
  cannot be another instance of softwareupdater.py running, or the restart
  tests will fail.  Note that when running these tests on Windows, ps cannot 
  be used to check process status.  You will have to do this yourself in the
  task manager.
  
  Each rsync unit test has 3 lines of output.  The first is the webserver
  telling you the ip address it is listening on (this should be the address
  of the local machine).  The second line is the local folder that the 
  webserver is serving.  The third line notes the type of test, the url being
  passed to rsync, and whether or not the test passed.
  
  For the restart test, initially there should be only one softwareupdater
  running.  The return code that is printed next should be 10, and there
  should still be only one softwareupdater running after this.  The finally,
  there should be output saying "Second update a success!".
  
<Side Effects>
  If everything is successful, there will be an instance of softwareupdater.py
  and nmmain.py running when this script completes.  It is non-trivial to clean
  this up here, because we do not directly start these processes.

<Inner Workings>
  To start, the tests need to create folders that the softwareupdater will be
  able to try to get updates from.  The softwareupdater itself must also be
  modified so that it is looking for the correct update site and has the
  correct testing key.  Also, once the folders are created, nminit.py needs to
  do its thing so the softwareupdater can do its service logging.  All these
  things are done by the create_folders function in test_updater.  The folders
  are created via tempfile.mkdtemp so they can be easily cleaned away when the
  tests are done running.  Once we have everything set up properly, we can then
  run the tests.

  First we start by running the rsync only tests.  These tests just test the 
  do_rsync method of the softwareupdater by importing softwareupdater and
  calling it manually.  Before the start of each test we must start a 
  webserver that will serve files from whatever folder has the appropriate 
  files for the current test.  Because the webserver is restricted to only
  serving files in its current directory, we cannot just run one webserver
  that serves files for all of the tests.  Once the test is done, we need to
  kill the webserver as well, so there won't be any conflicts when starting
  up the next one.

  Once the rsync tests are done running, we run the tests that make sure the
  whole softwareupdater is capable of running, updating, and restarting itself
  if need be.  For this we first point it at an update that will change its
  key, then at an update that requires that new key, but just updates the
  node manager.

    testtype - The type of rsync test to run.  Test types are reproduced here:
        -u <filename1 filename2 ... >    Test will assert that all of the given

    There will be an attempted update to the current folder.  If the update is
