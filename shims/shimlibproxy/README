1. OVERVIEW
   When developing networking application, the software developer has to take 
   into account the various network environments in order to ensure that the
   application runs smoothly. However this is a quite difficult task as it is
   hard to take into account every single network situations. Shims framework
   allows developers to use existing shims or write their own shims to easily
   address difficulties that may arise in different networking environments.

   There are already many pre-existing applications that are commonly used,
   which do not have shims implemented. The Shims proxy allows an user to 
   easily configure legacy applications to ensure that the application uses
   shims for network connectivity. In order to do this, the variable
   LD_PRELOAD will have to be set with the libnetworkinterpose.so library file.

2. OBTAINING SOFTWARE
   Latest version of libnetworkinterpose.so can be checked out from the svn at
   https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/svn/seattle/branches/repy_v2/shims/shimlibproxy/

3. BUILDING BINARIES
   Simply run make from the command line when you are in the shimlibproxy/ 
   directory.

4. INSTALLATION
   Once the library file has been compiled, simply copy over the library file
   libnetworkinterpose.so to a directory where you want to store it. If you
   are l33t enough to have root priviledges on the machine you can follow the
   system-wide configuration below.

5. PER-USER CONFIGURATION
   If you want to load the libnetworkinterpose.so for your application in order
   to enable shims for a legacy application, you must modify the LD_PRELOAD
   variable in order to let glibc know which libraries to pre-load for your 
   application. 

   EXAMPLE
   $ export LD_PRELOAD
   $ LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libnetworkinterpose.so
