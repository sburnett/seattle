socketlikeobj.recv(int length)

summary:
  recieves a string of length characters from a stream abstraction

argument semantics: (no tested)
  
  length is not at int - TypeError
  lenth is < 1 - ValueErro

behavioral semantics

  recv is blocking when there are no characters to recv
  (tested - test_recv_blocks.py) 

  with m > n if m characters are waiting and recv(n) is called, n characers
  are returned  
  (tested - test_recv_some.py)

  recv will return with n characters when recv(m) is called and n characters
  are waiting to be read and m > n
  (tested- test_recv_all.py)

  with m > n, if recv(m) is called and is blocking and a string of n is sent
  all n characters will be returned from the call.
  (tested - test_recv_while_blocking.py)

  if recv has been called after either side of the connection has called 
  close() an expection DOES NOT occur. characters are returned until
  buffers are empty, and then the empty string is returend
  (tested test_recv_after_peer_close.py)
  
  if recv is called after close() is called locally an exception occurs
  (tested - test_recv_after_self_close_1.py  not blocking call
   tested - test_recv_after_self_close_2.py  blocking call to recv)
