Socket like object  -  Send(message)


  summary:  sends a string over a tcp like connection

  argument semantics:  (not currently tested)
  
     message is not a str (or can't be automatically converted to one) 
     - Type Error  
     (no test)

    

  behavioral semantics

    block on send-

      typically is not blocking
      (tested - test_send_not_blocking.py)

      will block when nessicary if internal buffer is full
      ? how important is the size of this buffer? do we need to specify
      some sort of constraint on it?
      (tested - test_send_blocks.py)

      timeout - the tcp connection tiems out, exception is thrown
      (no test)

      
      send after self close()   -  causes exception (Socket Closed)
      (tested - test_send_after_self_close_1.py )

 
      send after peer close() - a call to close() should close the connection
        entirely, so a call to send() should throw an exception assuming 
        sufficent time has passed since the remote host called close()
        (tested - test_send_after_peer_close_1.py, FAILS - the first send() will
         pass, but the second one fails. )

      blocking send when peer calls close() - an exception should occur
        (tested - test_send_after_peer_close2.py)
