 
socketlikeobj.close()

summary:

  closes a tcp like connection.  In the repy implementaion close() is a
  operation (closes both sides of the connection)

argument sematnics:
  None

behavioral semantics:

  close() is called on an unopen connection - this fails quietly
  (tested - test_close_closed.py)

  a call to close should not return until the connection is truly closed
  and could therefore be reused.  (an opencnon using the same 4-tuple should
  succeed immediately after a close is done)
  (tested test_close_blocks.py  FAILS)
