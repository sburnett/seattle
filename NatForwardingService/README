TO BUILD FOR TESTING

  First you must create a prepared test directory
  From trunk run "mkdir basictest"
  Then (from trunk) run "python preparetest basictest"
  WARNING: if basictest is out of sync with svn then your test environment is no good

  "cd trunk/NatService_shimbased"

  "./build.sh"  

  
TO RUN TESTS

  Local tests (with no advertising)

  Open a new window and launch a forwarder
  "cd trunk/NatService_shimbased/build"
  "python repy.py restrictions.normal Nat_Forwarder.repy 127.0.0.1 12345 -na"
  
  Open another window to run tests in
  In that window "cd trunk/NatService_shimbased"
  "python run_tests.py"
