<Purpose>
  This program provides methods that interface with emulabs XML_RPC server.  
  
  The intention of this program is for these methods to be called as part of
  the Seattle autograding framework

  SSH is used to connect to the emu lab server without having to provide a
  password.  SSH keys must manually be set up between the client running this 
  code and the emulab server.  The constant "login_id" below must be changed to
  the login matching the keys that will be used to connect.

  For this program to run in must import two EMU-LAB Programs, sshxmlrpc.py
  and emulabclient.py.
