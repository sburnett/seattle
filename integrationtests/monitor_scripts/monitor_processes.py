  <Purpose>
    Runs at regular time intervals to make sure that critical processes on a machine
    are still up and running. If a critical process is not running then system admins
    are sent an email, as well as a message is posted on the IRC.
	
  <Exceptions>
    None

  <Usage>
    This script takes no arguments. A typical use of this script is to
    have it run periodically using something like the following crontab line:  
	
    */15 * * * * export GMAIL_USER='username' && export GMAIL_PWD='password' && /usr/bin/python /home/seattle/monitor_scripts/monitor_processes.py > 
    /home/seattle/monitor_scripts/cron_log.monitor_processes
