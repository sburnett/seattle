  <Purpose>
    To setup a job using crontab on a Linux machine ONLY.

  <Exceptions>
    If OS is not Linux, then the crontab setup will not work and throw an
    UnsupportedOSError exception.
    Throws an PreviousCronJobExists if the crontab already contains a line with
    the job that the user is trying to setup

  <Usage>
    add_crontab(<crontab_line>, <cron_name>)
    The purpose of the cron_name is purely to check that a previous job has not
    been created.

  <Result>
    Returns true if the crontab was setup properly
