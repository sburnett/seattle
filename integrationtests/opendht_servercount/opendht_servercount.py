<Usage>
  This script takes no argument. Just make sure all the required
  files are in the directory and run the program and redirect its
  output to some log file.

  runs periodically. Once a day should be enough for this program.

  Example:
  0 3 * * * /usr/bin/python /home/itegrationtests/opendht_servercount.py >> /home/integrationtests/cron_log.opendht_servercount
