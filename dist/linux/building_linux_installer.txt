To build the linux installer (will be automated soon):
1. Go to trunk and run 'python preparetest.py dist/linux/seattle_repy'
2. Go to the seattle_repy folder and run 'python nminit.py'
3. Clean up the seattle_repy folder as instructed in preparetest_files.txt (found in the parent directory)
4. Run 'cp scripts/* seattle_files/*'.
5. Run 'tar -czvf seattle_linx.tgz seattle_repy/'

You're good to go!
