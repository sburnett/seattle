To build the linux installer (will be automated soon):
1. Go to trunk and run 'python preparetest.py dist/linux/seattle_repy'
2. Go to the seattle_repy folder and run 'python nminit.py'
3. Clean up the seattle_repy folder as instructed in preparetest_files.txt (found in the parent directory)
4. Goto the dist/linux directory and run 'cp scripts/* seattle_repy/'.
5. Run 'tar -czvf seattle_linux.tgz seattle_repy/'
6. Delete the seattle_repy/ directory.

You're good to go!
