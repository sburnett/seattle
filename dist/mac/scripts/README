Seattle: the Internet as a Testbed

Seattle is a platform for networking and distributed systems research.  It's
free, community-driven, and offers a large deployment of computers spread across
the world.  Seattle runs on end user systems on diverse platforms in a safe and
contained manner.  This is achieved primarily by the use of repy (Restricted
Python, a subset of Python) which appropriately restricts the kinds of advanced
operations that could compromise the machines running our software.  To learn
in more detail about Seattle and how it works, visit our wiki:

Installation Instructions:
install.sh [key-bitsize]

Simply run the install.sh script to install Seattle on your system. The
installation process involves configuring our files to work correctly on your
system, generating the encryption keys to be used by our Node Manager program,
and setting up Seattle to run in the background in order to manage the resources
you are donating to the project.

key-bitsize: This optional argument allows you to specify the bitsize of the
	     encryption keys that the Node Manager will use. Default: 1024 bits.




Uninstall Instructions:
uninstall.sh

To uninstall, which will cause Seattle to stop running on your system and
prevent you from donating resources from your machine, run the uninstall.sh
script.  Once this script has been executed, it is safe to completely remove
the Seattle directory from your system.




Useful Commands:
stop_seattle.sh

To temporarily stop Seattle from running on your machine, execute the
stop_seattle.sh script.  This will disable Seattle from executing either until
you run the start_seattle.sh script or reboot your machine, whichever occurs
first.


start_seattle.sh
To restart Seattle running on your system, simply run the start_seattle.sh
script.  Once this script is executed, Seattle will run as though it had never
been stopped after the installation.
