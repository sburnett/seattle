This file describes the purpose and usage of each file in the current
directory and summarizes the purpose of each subdirectory.

=files=
==manifest.txt=
This file (see description at top).

==sitecustomize.py==
Included in the Windows Mobile installer, this file is copied to the
directory on the phone where python is installed (specified in
repy_constants.py) so that we can import seattle files. First, it
is preprocessed, with all instances of %PROG_PATH% replaced by the
actual path to the seattle directory.

==start_seattle.py==
Included in the Windows Mobile installer, this script will start
the scripts which comprise seattle when run.

==uncap.py==
Included in the Windows Mobile installer, this script will change
the names of each file in the directory from which it is run to all
lowercase. Helpful on some phones because of copying case errors.

==uninstall.py==
Included in the Windows Mobile installer, this script will kill all
running seattle processes and remove the seattle starter script from
the startup folder when run.
