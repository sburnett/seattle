  <Purpose>
    Removes seattle from the Windows startup registry key.

  <Arguments>
    None.
  
  <Exceptions>
    WindowsError if the uninstaller is unable to access and manipulate the
    Windows registry.

  <Side Effects>
    seattle is removed from the following Windows registry key which runs
    programs at machine startup:
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
