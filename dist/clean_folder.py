<Purpose>
  Parses an instructions file and uses it to check/clean a directory.
  The instructions file should have the following format:
    
    req required_file_1
    req at_least, one_of_these, is_required
    
    del bad_file
    del *.pyc
    del bad_file_number?

    # This line is a comment
    req file_4 # Comments can be inline

  Invalid lines in instructions files (non-empty lines that do not start with
  "req", "del", or "#") will cause warnings to be printed.  Files in directory
  that are not listed in the instructions file while be printed as warnings. 
  If one file is both required and deleted, the program quits with a ParseError.

  <Purpose>
    Given an instructions file and a directory, it will make sure that
    the directory matches the instructions, deleting files where necessary,
    printing errors where files are missing, and printing warnings where
    unrecognized files exist.
    
  <Arguments>
    instr_path:
      The location of the instructions file to be used.
    dir_to_clean:
      The location of the directory to be cleaned.

  <Exceptions>
    IllegalArgError on bad filepaths.
    ParseError on invalid instructions file.

  <Side Effects>
    None.

  <Returns>
    None.
