Module: Node Manager main program.   It initializes the other modules and
        doesn't do much else.

Start date: September 3rd, 2008

This is the node manager for Seattle.   It ensures that sandboxes are correctly
assigned to users and users can manipulate those sandboxes safely.

The design goals of this version are to be secure, simple, and reliable (in 
that order).

The node manager has several different threads.

   An advertisement thread (nmadverise) that inserts entries into OpenDHT so 
that users and owners can locate their vessels.
   A status thread (nmstatusmonitor) that checks the status of vessels and 
updates statuses in the table used by the API.
   An accepter (nmconnectionmanager) listens for connections (preventing
simple attacks) and puts them into a list.
   A worker thread (used in the nmconnectionmanager, nmrequesthandler, nmAPI)
handles enacting the appropriate actions given requests from the user.
   The main thread initializes the other threads and monitors them to ensure
they do not terminate prematurely (restarting them as necessary).
